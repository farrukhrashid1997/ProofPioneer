For instance, on Nov. 10, 2024, the TikTok account Mouse Trap News posted a clip claiming that the park planned to close the exhibit following U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's victory against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.
Some followers seemed to interpret the rumor as a factual recounting of real-life events. One TikTok commenter wrote, ""Donald trump is controversial but some presidents literally had slaves,"" while another responded, ""If this is true woke marketing makes no sense especially when the election proved the consumer base is majority Trump approved.""
The claim was also shared on the Mouse Trap News website a day earlier in an article providing additional detail about Disney's purported closure of the presidential exhibit:
Disney Permanently Closing The Hall of Presidents
Disney is permanently closing the Hall of Presidents. This announcement comes only days after Donald Trump won the presidential election.
According to an internal source, Disney no longer wants to have such a divisive show inside their theme park. They mentioned that the re-election of Donald Trump would make the attraction too controversial and isn't in the spirit of Disney. After all, they already had plans to remove President Trump, which we reported on here.
Our source also mentioned that Imagineers were already working on a Kamala Harris animatronic. However, the election results didn't follow their plan. In 2016, they made this same mistake with Hillary Clinton.
Imagineers had already created the animatronic, but then Trump won. Instead of scraping the work, they decided to rework the animatronic into President Trump. However, that's not as easy with Kamala Harris for obvious reasons. They have decided it's easier and better to just close the attraction permanently.
Luckily, instead of just scrapping everything in the ride, Disney will sell the presidential animatronics at an auction. So if you want an animatronic of any of the past presidents, you can bid on them. It's not yet clear what will take the place of the Hall of Presidents once it closes.
However, there was no evidence to support this claim. No such announcement was reported by any reputable news outlet or any of Disney Co.'s official websites.
Rather, the rumor originated with Mouse Trap News, a website that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature. Its ""About"" page states:
Mouse Trap News is the world's best satire and parody site. We write fake stories about Disney Parks stuff. From Disney Park announcements to Disney Hotel and resort news to made-up Disney partnerships, you can be assured that anything you read here is not true, real, or accurate, but it is fun. So technically our slogan The Moused Trusted Name in Disney News isn't true, but we thought it was creative and funny, so we are running with it.
Moreover, the Mouse Trap News TikTok account describes itself as ""Real Disney News That is 100% FAKE‚ÄºÔ∏è""
Snopes has addressed similar claims in the past about the Trump statue inside Disney's Hall of Presidents, including the satirical assertion in December 2023 that the entertainment company had decided to remove the animatronic figure from Disney World, and the true claim of a photograph showing the Trump figure housed within the exhibit.
For background, here is why we alert readers to rumors created by sources that call their output humorous or satirical."

No credible news sources or official announcements from the grocery chains support this claim.",,Politics,False,"['Kroger', 'Politics', 'Publix', 'Food Lion', 'Donald Trump', '2024 Election']","We located no credible announcements about these three grocery store chains announcing such a price cut. This news was not genuine and originated on a website describing its content as parody and satire.
A rumor that Kroger, Food Lion and Publix announced a 4% price cut circulated widely online in November 2024. According to the rumor, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's Nov. 5 reelection victory inspired the American grocery store brands to reach the decision.
For example, on Nov. 10, 2024, the Soul Alchemy Facebook page posted (archived), ""Kroeger [sic], Food Lion, and Publix all announced a 4 percent price cut across the board. He's already making a difference."" The post displayed over 1,300 reactions.
Other Facebook users also shared the same copied-and-pasted rumor, with some of them correcting the incorrect spelling of ""Kroeger"" to read, ""Kroger, Food Lion, and Publix all announced a 4 percent price cut across the board. He's already making a difference.""
Some of these readers seemed to interpret the rumor as a factual recounting of real-life events. For example, some users commented of the supposed news, ""What a blessing,"" ""Gotta love that man!!!!,"" ""Woohoo! #winning,"" ""Now if Calif and other states grocers would follow"" and ""Trump baby.""
However, there was no evidence of Kroger, Food Lion or Publix announcing such a price cut thanks to Trump's victory.
Rather, the rumor about the grocery store chains originated with America's Last Line of Defense (ALLOD) network of Facebook pages and websites. The ALLOD network's primary Facebook page describes its content as ""satire/parody"" and an ""entertainment website."" It also dubs itself as a ""network of trollery,"" and adds in its introduction: ""Nothing on this page is real.""
The ALLOD network posted the rumor on Nov. 9 to its Reagan Was Right Facebook page. Two days later, on Nov. 11, it shared the same rumor yet again on its Facebook page America - Love It Or Leave It. Both pages displayed labels notifying readers of the content containing satire and parody.
Snopes has addressed similar satirical claims from ALLOD in recent months, including the claim that the Quaker Oats Co. announced Aunt Jemima will return to the packaging of syrup bottles in 2025, as well as the rumor podcaster Joe Rogan added 3 million subscribers after he announced an interview with Trump.

Beauty company Sephora donated to President-elect Donald Trump's political campaign.,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sephora-donation-trump-campaign/,@karressmarie,,November 2024,2024-11-12,"A viral TikTok video falsely claimed that Sephora donated to Donald Trump's campaign.  This claim is unsupported by evidence.  Searches of the Federal Election Commission database revealed no such donation from Sephora or its parent company, LVMH.

In the original video, which offered no evidence to back the claim, TikTok user @karressmarie wrote ""Sephora BIG BIG BIG DONATIONS!!"" The video ended by saying, ""I HOPE we all understand the assignment for this Christmas season!"" As of this writing, the video has received more than 13.7 million views and 1.8 million likes.
@karressmarie4 Well well well‚Ä¶ üòèü´° #christmas #christmasdecor #christmastiktok ‚ô¨ Bring Em Out - T.I.
The claim quickly made its way to other platforms, including dozens of posts on official Sephora website forums.
(community.sephora.com)
We looked into the claim and found that it was entirely made up. There is no evidence that Sephora donated to Trump's campaign or any other political campaign. We searched the Federal Election Commission (FEC) website and found no record of LVMH, the beauty chain's parent company, making contributions to a political candidate as an organization. However, individual employees of the company donated more than $35,000 collectively to Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, according to OpenSecrets.
We reached out to Sephora seeking clarification on the rumor, and they responded as follows:
It has come to our attention that there is incorrect information circulating on social media regarding company donations. Sephora does not make corporate donations to political candidates. Sephora's mission is to create a welcoming beauty shopping experience for all.
Some comments online went a step further and claimed that the CEO of LVMH, Bernard Arnault, is friends with Trump.
(community.sephora.com)
Although there is insufficient evidence to confirm that Arnault supports Trump, he did meet with the CEO in Texas in 2019 to cut the ribbon on a new Louis Vuitton workshop.

In sum, the rumor that Sephora or its parent company, LVMH, donated to Trump's campaign was entirely made up. Because there is no evidence that any such donation occurred and Sephora confirmed the company does not make corporate donations to political candidates, we rate this claim false."

However, there was no real evidence of Rutte making the statement, which would have generated news headlines if he had actually said it. The quote was fabricated. A NATO spokesperson said the claim was ""bogus.""
As secretary-general, Rutte does not have the authority to ""personally expel"" a country from the alliance. While he leads the alliance, according to NATO's website, ""authority for taking decisions is invested only in the member governments themselves.""

I congratulate Donald Trump on his election as President of the United States.
I look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength through NATO.
Through NATO, the US has 31 friends and Allies who help to advance US interests, multiply American power and keep Americans safe.
Together, NATO Allies represent half of the world's economic might and half of the world's military might.
We face a growing number of challenges globally, from a more aggressive Russia, to terrorism, to strategic competition with China, as well the increasing alignment of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.
Working together through NATO helps to deter aggression, protect our collective security, and support our economies.

First of all, of course, I want to congratulate again, President Trump, upon his re-election. It was really a huge success for him, including capturing the House and the Senate. I look forward to work with him again. When he was president he was the one in NATO who stimulated us to move over the 2% and now also thanks to him, in NATO, if you take out the numbers of the US for a moment, is above the 2% and I think very much that is his doing, his success, and we need to do more. We know this today.
Today on my mind in this meeting is what is happening now with North Koreans being deployed in Russia. And what we see more and more is that North Korea, Iran, China and of course, Russia are working together, working together against Ukraine, but at the same time, Russia has to pay for this, and one of the things they are doing is delivering technology to North Korea, which is now threatening the future the mainland of the US, continental Europe, but also our partners in Indo, Pacific, Japan, for example, and Republic of Korea. So these are really dangerous new developments, and we need to discuss that today.
But I also look forward to sit down with President Trump and to navigate how collectively we'll make sure that we face this threat and that we keep our part of the world safe.
During his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed he could quickly end the war in Ukraine but did not offer details on how, The Associated Press reported. He has also been critical of the amount of aid the United States has sent to the country, and at one point, he"

Some posts suggested that this was intended as a show of control over Donald Trump. ""This is Russia's state-run media airing salacious pictures of the future First Lady, Melania Trump. This is Putin letting Trump know that he is in charge. Watch as Trump rolls over,"" one X post claimed.

""Russia show nude pics of Melania Trump on prime time TV. Some bits of the photo are blurred, strange you can't show an a** crack on Russian TV, but you can blatantly see 2 c****,"" another commented.
The claim also spread on other social media platforms, including YouTube, Reddit, Threads, TikTok and Facebook, as well as websites such as Daily Star, Mint, The Maltese Herald and Hindustan Times.
An article published on Nov. 8, 2024, by Vox News Albania read: ""Russia's largest television 'denigrates' the First Lady and publishes 'embarrassing' photos of Melania just 1 day after Trump's victory.""
In short, because Russian state TV did indeed air revealing photos of Melania Trump taken during her modeling career shortly after the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we have rated this claim as true.

The video containing clips from Russian state TV was shared on Nov. 11, 2024, on the YouTube channel of Russian News Monitor, a project of Daily Beast columnist Julia Davis that tracks Russian state media propaganda trends.
Davis also shared it on her X account on Nov. 8, 2024, writing ""Meanwhile in Russia: this is how the most watched state TV channel in the country welcomed Melania Trump's upcoming return to the White House. Olga Skabeeva is trying not to laugh. This was probably her idea.""
The segments featured in the video aired on Nov. 7, 2024, during ""60 –º–∏–Ω—É—Ç"" (""60 Minutes""), a Russian political talk show on the Russia 1 channel, hosted by Skabeeva and Evgeny Popov.
The program was available on Smotrim.ru website, an official online platform of Russian state television.
The video shared on social media was compiled from separate excerpts featuring Melania Trump, taken from a program aired in Russia at 6:30 p.m. at timestamps: 41:35-42:18, 42:33-42:48, 43:34-43:42 and 45:28-45:33.
