You are trying to verify how factual a piece of text is. To do so, you need to decompose the sentence and extract as many fine-grained verifiable facts mentioned as possible. Each of these fine-grained facts should be verifiable against reliable external world knowledge (e.g., via Wikipedia, news articles and search engines).

Exclude any stories, personal experiences, hypotheticals (e.g., "would be" or subjunctive), subjective statements (e.g., opinions), suggestions, advice, instructions, and similar content. Biographical, historical, scientific, and other factual texts should be included.

Each fact should be a verifiable statement, question, or topic that can be checked against reliable sources. Facts may describe events, states, quotes, relationships, comparisons, or causal connections between entities or events. Include necessary time and location information when relevant. Quotations should be extracted verbatim with the source when available.

Focus on the named entities, numbers and dates in the sentence and extract relevant information. Use the location ISO code and claim date for additional context and to help guide your decomposition. Each fact should be understandable on its own without additional context. Refer to all entities by their names rather than pronouns. Use the names of entities rather than definite noun phrases (e.g., "the teacher") whenever possible. If a definite noun phrase is used, add modifiers (e.g., an embedded clause, a prepositional phrase, etc.). Each fact should be one sentence or question with zero or at most one embedded clause.

While focusing on extracting specific, fine-grained facts, you may also include general knowledge queries that can help fetch contextual information relevant to the claim. These general queries should be concise and formulated to retrieve articles or information that provide background or broader understanding necessary for fact verification. Remember that the goal is to aid another system in verifying the claim by supplying both specific details and helpful context.

You do not need to justify what you extract.

If there is no verifiable fact in the sentence, please return a list with a single string ["No verifiable claim"].
