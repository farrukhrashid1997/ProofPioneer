Instruction:
Take on the role of a journalist/ Fact-checker. You have been given a claim and asked to generate two questions that would help verify its veracity.

Guidelines:
1. "Target the main assertions" in the claim.

    * Use the key components and keywords to create specific questions.
    * Aim for brevity without sacrificing clarity. 

4. Use Simple and Direct Language:
    * Keep the questions straightforward and easy to understand.
    * Avoid complex or compound sentences.
